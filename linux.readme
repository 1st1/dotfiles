# macOS-ifying Linux

1. xkeysnail; config for it: dotfiles/etc/xkeysnail.py
   (don't forget to patch it to not use X)

2. logid; config for it: dotfiles/etc/logig.conf

3. Superhuman: chrome browser extension; use the
   "create shortcut" option to make it a standalone
   app.

4. tilix; the best iTerm2 replacement. No ebuild for it
   yet, but it's easy to build manually.

5. San Francisco font;

6. `gsettings set org.gnome.mutter overlay-key ''`
   to unbind the Super key from opening "Activities".
   Rebind them to "Super-SPACE" via Settings / Shortcuts.

   the Dark theme. Use them to also make the system
   use the SF fonts.

   * Custom hot corners
   * Kstatusnotifieritem/appindicator
   * Audio output switcher
   * Dash to dock
